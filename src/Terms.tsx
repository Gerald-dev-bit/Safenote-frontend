          Welcome to SafeNote.xyz, your secure haven for note-taking. We
          appreciate your interest in our platform and are pleased to offer
          these Terms of Service to guide your use. By accessing or using
          SafeNote.xyz, you agree to comply with these terms. If you do not
          agree, please refrain from using our services. We aim to provide a
          positive experience for all users while maintaining a safe and
          respectful community.
        </p>
        <p>
          SafeNote.xyz allows you to create, store, and manage personal notes in
          a protected online space. Our goal is to offer a simple, reliable tool
          for your daily needs, whether for personal journaling, work
          organization, or creative brainstorming. To use our services, you must
          be at least 13 years old and capable of forming a binding agreement.
          Accounts are intended for individual use only, and sharing credentials
          is prohibited to ensure security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating an account requires a valid email address and a strong
          password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
          your login credentials. If you forget your password, please note that
          we cannot recover it or provide a forgot password feature, as this
          enhances security by preventing unauthorized access attempts. In such
          cases, you may need to create a new account. We recommend using a
          password manager to keep track of your details safely and backing up
          important notes independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree to use SafeNote.xyz lawfully and respectfully. Prohibited

          viruses, malware, or any material that could damage our systems or
          other users. We do not monitor your notes but reserve the right to
          suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, such as those
          involved in illegal activities, spam, harassment, or distribution of
          copyrighted material without permission. Violations may result in
          immediate account closure without prior notice, and we may cooperate
          with law enforcement if necessary.
